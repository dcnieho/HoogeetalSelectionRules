This repository contains the data and classification algorithms used and
developed for the article Hooge, I.T.C., Niehorster, D.C., Nyström, M.,
Andersson, R. & Hessels, R.S. (in press). Fixation classification: how to merge
and select fixation candidates. Behavior Research Methods. For each of the algorithms in the
_classification algorithms_ directory, a file showing example use is included
in the same directory. Run the file called run* to test run the algorithm.

When using the classification algorithms or eye-tracking data in this
repository in your work, please cite the Hooge et al. (in press) paper.

Each of the algorithms has been modified by us. Therefore, if you use one of
the algorithms, please cite both the original paper describing the algorithm
and the Hooge et al. (in press) paper for which the modified versions were
developed. Specifically, for each of the algorithms, the following references
apply (full references are listed below):
